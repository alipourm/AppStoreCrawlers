As Amazon expands with other companies to make the Echo usful for talking to more devices. Not everyone can hook up to Alexa yet. This disadvantages those that do have Alexa. I bought the Fire stick believing that Alexa and the stick would talk to my TV like I saw on the Dish Network commercial. Amazon please make Alexa work with all HDTV by developing access or devices without having to by all these pieces. I believe Alexa or any communication device that creates a smart atmosphere is the future. I can see this technology, as it it develops, being present everywhere even in automobile. <div class=\"review-link\" style=\"display:none\"> <a class=\"id-no-nav play-button tiny\" href=\"#\" target=\"_blank\"> Full Review </a> </div> </div>"},

I don't understand why we don't have the option to have more than one list. Could it be that Amazon fears we might buy something from somewhere else besides Amazon?  Also, the list does not put enough items on a page (too much whitespace).  Deleting items should be done by checking boxes and then clicking a single delete button.

The echo device is great once setup. But the setup process is too painful and annoying. During setup at times it just doesn't recognize wifi networks. If I change my wifi passpord, running the whole setup is too difficult. The app ( or rather the website undeneath app ) also gets unresponsive sometimes in few setup screens, specially after the app connects to echo and it shows a 'Continue' button which doesn't respond. EDIT: I got a new echo Dot and setup is hung up on step showing 'Attempting to connect to echo dot'. The phone got connected to the dots WiFi but nothing happens in setup process.

Couple of things need to happen though. Needs a volume widget option. I cant seem to find one. More importantly the list function needs help i shoild be able to make multiple shopping lists for things. Grocery car household ect. Should be able customize that. In addition i should be able to tell it to add a group of things and have them show up as individual items. So i need eggs cheese bred milk. All in one sentence finally i want it to automatically group things at least by hot and cold items but even better if it could recognize delli meat produce ect.  Do that and 5 stars all day. Needs a little work yet on voice recognition but pretty good. <div class=\"review-link\" style=\"display:none\"> <a class=\"id-no-nav play-button tiny\" href=\"#\" target=\"_blank\"> Full Review </a> </div> </div>"},

Voice recognition can be hit and miss, it needs some work before it's completely outclassed by competitors.

Sometimes it works and other times it tells you that you can only stream on one device at a time.
