Like most corporations they share with their partners which makes sense; however, how that information is protected and used beyond them is unspecified and not protected by the privacy policy. I would prefer apps and devices independent of GPS tracking, cloud based services, and data collection.  They should work independently of their creators. I like IP enabled devices that can be managed outside of their creators. I would be more comfortable with Quickset if they offered an app and device that did not collect or connect online.

I'm using a Samsung Galaxy S7 on Android 6.1 and its reliability has dropped to such a low point that I now need to carry physical keys with me because it only works less than 40% of the time. Sometimes I log off and back on the app works and sometimes it doesn't. I'm having the same issue on a second phone and iPhone 6's. These are both Kevo 1st generation deadbolts.  Same issue with both locks. <div class=\"review-link\" style=\"display:none\"> <a class=\"id-no-nav play-button tiny\" href=\"#\" target=\"_blank\"> Full Review </a> </div> </div>"},

The app used to work fine on my phone until the most recent update in September 2017 and now it hasn't worked since. I feel like I've been scammed on a $230 lock that I now have to carry a key with me all the time. TiVo needs to step up their game quickly!

Based on other user reviews, apparently most android phones aren't supported. Prior to my note 8 my moto z would constantly stop working or reading the kevo, same with a pixel. It's apparent android isnt supported by kevo, but if so it should not be marketed as such... save me the headache and I would not have purchased!! Anyone reading this, don't buy (assuming you dont have an iPhone, because why would you be in the play store?) <div class=\"review-link\" style=\"display:none\"> <a class=\"id-no-nav play-button tiny\" href=\"#\" target=\"_blank\"> Full Review </a> </div> </div>"},

The latest updates really have improved the range and consistency with which is detects devices, and has eliminated most of the lag between when you touch your Kevo and when it actually unlocks. Not quite ready for prime-time yet, still a little flaky and will leave you standing at your door touching the lock wondering why it's not locking/unlocking every couple of times you to go use it. Fobs.. those still seem to be something of a dumpster fire. But hey, at least with the app on your phone things are improving! <div class=\"review-link\" style=\"display:none\"> <a class=\"id-no-nav play-button tiny\" href=\"#\" target=\"_blank\"> Full Review </a> </div> </div>"},
