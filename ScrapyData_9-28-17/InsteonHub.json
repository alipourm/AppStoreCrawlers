I've submitted complains to smarthome and they claim to have someone on the case. This was 3 months ago. I'm going to find another product to invest in that is more reliable that this garbage!

The use of widgets would be a huge help as some of the other reviews mention.  Also, some tasks could easily be reduced to 1 step instead of 2.

I also have SmartThings and apart from hardware-based Insteon linking (with the buttons on the switches) I do all automation within SmartThings.
