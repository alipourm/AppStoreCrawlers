It ends up being quicker to talk to Google assistant to turn on the lights. Also. It'd be nice if when the app finally connects what ever setting I had last on the app would sync with the bulbs.

The app UI is simple, once you figure it out. I admit I didn't pay attention to the tutorial. Maybe have a way to restart the tutorial or a link to help in about section. The ability to reorganize and delete scenes on long press is really nice. The timers are fun but too cumbersome to access and set up to be really useful for short duration. I am going to look at Alexa and IFTTT for a faster timer experience. The location features are great when they work.

It does keep popping up saying 'Out of home' connection quite regularly whilst I'm at home if I use my WiFi extender. The Hue hub is direct wired to my Sky Hub and signal strength is pretty good throughout the house so I don't know why. Love the home and away routines; it's great to come home to light so I'm not blind when I go indoors lol. Great work, Philips. Next please add G9 smart bulbs and I'll be happy. Also, just a thought, add a way to make one light fitting/location include multiple bulbs so they can sync the same way.
