On my tablet it is glitchy .  The blue circle keeps spinning in the middle of my image.  I am unable to review video from earlier in the day.  The time line feature will not load.  On my phone when  I'm trying to review a video from earlier in the day and I tap on the screen the  forward or reverse option randomly appears. It's a pain in the ass to try and review any video.  The time line is too sensitive. It drives me crazy. And I'm paying for the 10 day cloud recording.

However, I'm really disappointed that the ability to add others is an all or nothing premise, still, after all this time.    I'd love to see the ability to actually have the \"owner\" account be able to assign each connected device individually as well as just what actions they are able to perform with the device(s).    Having everyone with God Mode isn't very encouraging to add others with when you've now just automatically allowed them to effectively delete the account and all devices... when I may have just wanted to give them a range of temperatures they can set between a certain time on certain days, for example. <div class=\"review-link\" style=\"display:none\"> <a class=\"id-no-nav play-button tiny\" href=\"#\" target=\"_blank\"> Full Review </a> </div> </div>"},

Constantly fiddling with the damn thing. When I go into a single camera view and hit forward or backwards, 9 times out of 10 the stupid thing will jump to either the most current stream or some random spot in the history. It takes multiple tries and tons of patience to finally get it to work right... if it ever works right. Often I just give up.  Also, the recognition algorithm sucks. Always getting false person alerts or no alerts at all when a person is actually there. I mean I guess it's great that my video history is all in the cloud somewhere if and when I need it, but viewing anything meaningful in this app is a lesson in futility...
