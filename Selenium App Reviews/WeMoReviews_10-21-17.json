I'm a crypto currency miner and I love the fact I can track my usage and be able to remotely reboot my computers. Only thing I don't like is the power button that is actually on the device itself. Sometimes I reach to touch the wemo to see if it's hot and I accidentally switch the power off as the switch is far too sensitive. Also it's rated at 1800 watts but when I push 12/1300 watts thru it, it gets very hot. This makes me a tad bit nirvous... But other than that works like a charm."}

Ill keep trying, but if I cant find a solution to remotely controlling the plug over my VPN, Ill have to return the device. Major bummer.  Just got this (9/9/17.) So far so good, this wemo MINI is everything Ive been looking for: 1. A connected outlet, providing simple on/off control from my phone/tablet devices. 2. It HAD to be accessible from the internet, NOT through a wemo account/servers, but instead over my own VPN connection to my LAN. 3. An app with reasonable permissions, that I can deny on a per-feature basis, without breaking the app. 4. Finally, I need it to be reliable. (Manual control of firmware updates should contribute to that, but Id like to see a detailed change log displayed when they are offered.) This wemo device and app are, so far, on par with my Hue lights for function, ease of use, and flexibility. If this continues to hold true, I can see more wemo devices in my future. wemo, so far, is a pleasant surprise, in a world of over reaching, flaky, and consumer-hostile software, hardware, and services."}

To get 5 stars, app needs streamlined workflow for setting up new wemo minis without the confusion for android devices and auto network select. Would also need a much more responsive app overall. The time between a tap and a reaction is several seconds and there is often no indication that a tap occured and the app was doing things. My guess is that wemo outsourced the creation of this app without a lot of QA on the release because internally developed apps rarely have this poor of an experience."}

I use a VPN and sometimes the bulbs are recognized and sometimes they aren't, which means I need to turn off the VPN, open the app and turn on my lights, and then turn on my VPN again. I implore you to buy any other brand of smart bulb or switch instead of this very mediocre technology. I took the cheap route and I regret it.  I own 7 bulbs, a wemo link, an insight and a switch. It took 4 support people and over 5 hours of talk time to get the products working properly.

Secondly, the app uses too much time when loading, this is because the app for some reason has to load every wemo device every time you go to the main screen.

It's great for those, but add more and then every firmware rollout, you are going to have failures. The maintenance of a single failed switch is going to cost you half a day at best, but perhaps a week or two.  And then... another failure is going to happen again next update. But at least you'll have practice this time   The future isn't here yet. Wait a little longer before investing in these."}

If the power goes off and on or the Internet is disconnected for a seconds, the device is likely not to operate and you actually have no way of knowing if it has worked or not unless you're sitting next to it. 3. The device (wemo switch) makes a high pitch whistling sound which is already giving me a headache. I can't have this in my home.  4. Once connected to power takes a couple of minutes to connect to the same wifi to which it was connected 5 minutes ago. (Seriously which technology are you guys using? ) I should tell you that I have got the latest wemo switch, the latest wemo app and have fully upgraded the firmware. Belkin guys, if you wanna make an improvement, the most important aspect is reliability. These devices are no good unless they can report their on/off status 100% accurate.

Reset the links, reset the light bulbs, restarted my android and reinstalled the Android app 5 times each. Right after finishing the set up, it works for 10 seconds then the app forgets everything and goes back to the first help screen again. I am guessing the app is faulty. Any help would be appreciated. This is an expensive joke for $100! A very slow joke! How about having this on two phones? Only one person can not have the keys? Hit and miss and not reliable, sometimes it says something is off or on but it is wrong! Why? The hardware is yours which you charged us more than $100 for it, the software is yours too and you can not make them work together!  By the time it gets loaded I can catch a taxi, go to airport, board a plane, go home, switch off the lights, make sure it is off, and come back! Using this at home? Forget about it, just turn off the switch manually. According to Google 0.5 million to 1 million people downloaded this, let's say also 1 million IPhone users downloaded this. Let's say a quarter of those bought more than one, maybe 2, 3, 4 or more for their business or home. It makes up to $300 million product!

Away mode settings displays that my WeMo is enabled to turn on and off at a schedule but I can't disable or delete it because it says I must select a device! However that is because it is the default view for no schedule! Very poor user experience throughout the application.  Turning the WeMo Insight on or off via the application frequently causes it to lose communication with the device. I couldn't figure out what would make it work again but it seems to resume working after several minutes. But it also stops working once I issue another on/off command again. This is a very poor experience.   Unless someone from Belkin can help me, I'm almost certain I am returning my WeMo Insight to Belkin to buy another brand's smart outlet device due to so many atrocious issues in just the first hour."}

Carefully following the non standard setup instructions requires several tries. The save after edit of previously scheduled task requires \"save\" after \"done\". The streamlined setup does not have the granularity for troubleshooting. It can and does in fact work often. But it also does not work part of the time. Because I have security concerns I'm only giving this app access to controllers for non-critical devices, such as a few lights around the house. They may have designed their product line for more casual users where performance, security, and troubleshooting aren't really a factor."}

Until I get the firmware updated, the devices won't connect to the SSID of the network I'm going to use them on (special characters in that SSID), so that's a big deal.  Got tired of the app prompting me to rate it so I went ahead and gave my initial opinion.  One last thing:  I went with WeMo over tp-link because the WeMo devices head higher average user reviews but it wasn't until after I started trying to set them up that I saw the TP link app had much higher reviews then the WeMo app.  If I had seen that before ordering, I would have probably ordered TP Link devices."}

I have a Google Home so I normally use that or Google Assistant on my Pixel XL to control me light switch and kitchen nightlight.   I am looking forward to the dimmer switch that will be released later this spring \u263a\ufe0f.    Original: I got a WeMo mini smart plug.  Has a hard time during initial setup on my Pixel XL.   I had to put it in airplane mode then connect to the WeMo's wifi, to keep it from connecting to cell.   Then I found out the \"connect to hidden wifi\" doesn't show up on my Pixel.   The screen dims when hitting the ... at top right but it doesn't show the menu that has Hidden network option listed.    I had to start broadcasting the SSID to get it setup and if I hide it after connecting, the switch loses its connection and won't reconnect.  I hope Belkin fixes this bug in the app and makes it easier to modify network settings after initial setup.  If they do I will update my review \u263a\ufe0f"}

We have a technical problem that we first noticed yesterday, but might have occurred as early as Feb 1st.  Both my phone and my wife's phone can only set one rule to be active at a time. We have two wemo wall outlets, and even if we try to activate rules that each only affect one of the devices, whatever the second rule (even if it's for the second device) it will just immediately switch \"on\" without doing the \"enabling rule\" spinner and the \"rule enabled\" blue bar confirmation. When we go out to the main page, the rule is still disabled.  This occurs even after rebooting her Nexus5x and my Xiaomi Mi 5.  The only way to get around this bug is by creating new rules, since they are automatically enabled when created. However, the new rules can't be disabled and then re-enabled if there is another rule enabled (the same limitation applies to them as old rules).  I don't like this as a long term solution, since it takes several clicks to edit times -I really liked having preset rules with common times that I can enable and disable (I'm using this as an alarm clock with strong lamps and sunlight lamps)."}

Initial setup months ago required many days of playing with to finally understand this app! So much potential -- but cant recommend this ecosystem to anyone but a masochist  Update: unable to get smart plug working after the update! Downgraded to 1 *... I'm done with this trash"}
