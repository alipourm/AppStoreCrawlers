By the way, the app has a \"scan QR code\" option, that doesn't work. So I manually enter the name and password on the hub. Then the app tells me it's looking for firmware update (no choice), which it never finishes. Restarting it, I see choices of devices to add. I have one: a wired dimmer.

I chose Insteon because of its X10 support but I'm a disappointed that there is no feedback that X10 commands have been dispatched and you can't even use X10 modules in scenes. This app is rated below 3 star (and dropping).  Come on Insteon how do you expect to excel with an app like this? Update: when I got home last night my X10 modules would not respond.  So I tried an Insteon module and it would not respond either.

{"Author": "Mario Martinez", "Date": "September 7, 2017", "Stars": " Rated 1 stars out of five stars ", "Text": "The latest update broke my activity zone notifications. I tried removing and reinstalling all my cameras and it's still messed up. Customer service was no help resolving the issue. I hope a future update fixes it.  Edit #1: I finally discovered (on my own) what the issue is. Unless you have \"person seen\" activated, you will not get notifications in an activity zone when someone walks by. With this option turned off, you will only get notifications for motion. For example: a bird flying by or waving your hand directly in front of the camera. This is extremely unfortunate for people who only want person seen notifications in specific activity zone instead of in the entire camera's field of vision. For example: a camera pointing outside where people regularly walk by, but you are only interested in notifications in a specific zone. The only other option is to turn on \"person seen\" and get a million notifications throughout the day and hope that one of them is within the activity zone you actually care about. I really hope they fix this so \"person seen\" is a unique option for each activity zone instead of the camera overall. Currently, it's a broken feature. Edit #2: still no good feedback from Nest on how to solve the notification issues. I've had to \"hack\" my cameras by smudging/dirtying the lens making the video quality blurry. This tricks the camera into not recognizing if a person walks in an activity zone. Instead, it only sees it as motion which results in the notifications I want. Pretty sad that I have to do this in order to get a simple feature to work. Edit #3: I unsubscribed from Nest Aware since there is still an issue with motion alerts and person alerts. No point in throwing away money."}

The new group is only interested in sales and has zero interest in supporting and improving the products beyond that. I have witnessed the decline in quality and service from Dropcam and am moving on. Disgusting to have the resources they do and not to utilize them by hiring good people to support their products/customers and by not investing in obviously needed improvements. Just read the real reviews, the ones that have similar complaints. The 5 star reviews with zero details are obviously created by Nest to boost their score...and how sad that they can't get above a measly 4.0. There is no way that this app is working well enough for anyone to rate it above a 1. Like I said, it's garbage. How anyone can feel good about working on this app and for this company is amazing.

It has a clean interface, has an excellent widget implementation, and is reasonably well featured. It would be great to see rooms replaced (or augmented) with groups, with lights being allowed in more than one group. It would be nice to trigger routines from a widget button, not just a time of day. It would be nice to have a \"fade off\" option, like in the win 10 app \"hue dynamic\". And it would be nice to expose the advanced tap and dimmer programming seen in other apps. But so far so good, it's the only hue app on my phone. I use \"hue dynamic\" to program my dimmers and taps."}

Imagine if every app on your home screen was in box with a darker bar over it with the name. It would look very over complicated. The only thing you should see is the button and the name.

And I can tell you as an iPad user location-aware works just fine on iOS.  That is, quite simply, tremendously disrespectful to Android customers and very unprofessional.  I do love the concept of this product, it's a great idea, but the way Philips had handled this issue, which is to say, basically ignoring well-paying customers who can't use their broken products the way it was advertised, leaves a bad taste in my mouth with this company.  I've seen no sort of explanation or apology from Philips about this.  Just a disgusting display of apathy given a glaringly broken significant feature that has remained that way for months and months months.  If someone can think of a legitimate excuse for that please let me know.  EDIT:  Downgraded to one star.  No excuse for them to take THIS long to fix the Geofencing.  You don't take YEARS to fix a bug if you really cared.  As a customer I'm disgusted.

This one will be in modern English and hopefully easy for Philip's (if they even read these) to understand. In short, THIS APP IS TERRIBLE!!! I don't give a lot of negative reviews not do I type in all caps much, but this app however, required a more direct approach. Philip's took a wonderfully functional, not without flaws but functional, and gave us this. The new app is convoluted, with many flaws. To list a small few :  - Control of individual lights is much more difficult. I don't always want every light in a room on.   - The entire concept of the \"scenes\" is poorly executed and not useful.   - Setup and modification of add-on switches and controls is beyond bad. store I'll stop there because I have better things to do with my day than audit a horrible app. It's really telling when the gen 1 version of the app has a 3.6 rating in the store currently, while the \"upgrade\" is at 2.9. Really, consider moving the team who created this to another part of your businesses and bring back the original team to update the old app. While there are far superior pay apps out there, I shouldn't have to buy an app just to get a usable product."}

It HAD to be accessible from the internet, NOT through a wemo account/servers, but instead over my own VPN connection to my LAN. 3. An app with reasonable permissions, that I can deny on a per-feature basis, without breaking the app. 4. Finally, I need it to be reliable. (Manual control of firmware updates should contribute to that, but Id like to see a detailed change log displayed when they are offered.) This wemo device and app are, so far, on par with my Hue lights for function, ease of use, and flexibility.

I have an issue with how the application shows me a loading screen, then it shows me a connecting to network screen, then it shows me the devices if they are detected, (they fail about 20% of the time) then it has to refresh the status on all devices. This means if i want to turn on the light for a room with my device i have to wait somewhere from 20 sec to 2 min to flip a light switch.  You need to cache this data and refresh it in the background, and use push messages on status changes for updates.  The app is also lacking widgets for the home screen, a fast easy way to toggle devices is critical for ease of use.

I use the same account on both my phone and my wife's phone so I did not have to generate another set of keys however this may cause me issues later, I guess I will find out. I love the fact that it does not connect to the Internet so it being hacked is less of a worry. Locks do not need access to the internet due to your phone being able to program them locally and you can email the ekey to someone if they need to get in without you being home. I have not tried this yet but hopefully will soon. The only issue I have at the moment is the possibility of your phone being too close to the lock while being home which can allow someone to walk up and unlock your door if your phone is too close. That can be solved by simply turning off your Bluetooth while at home but that is not something people will like to do. So far it works great with no issues."}

I can give someone temporary access or revoke anytime.  Very nice!"}

If you block the stupid notification then you can't get notifications about lock events.  And, BTW, it forces you to receive [useless] emails as well as push notifications for those events.  AND you have to set up each event (lock and unlock) separately for each individual key-holder!

When the direction tell you to follow in app instructions. You must first push the + sign in the app to add the hub. No where and I repeat no where that I looked whether it was online or in forums did it say this. Since then we have had the hub hooked up for a week with no issues. We have been using the lock for 3 weeks. We did notice before the hub there was a little bit of a lag when locking or unlocking by Bluetooth but since it seems to be more efficient.
